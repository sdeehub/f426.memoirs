Every journey begins with a single step.\\
In the beginning, your goal might look impossible.\\
People will tell you, "You can't do that."\\

You might even hear this from your friends and family.

Ignore them.\\
Keep going.

Before you know it, that single step has turned into 10.\\
Then 1000.

And now, your goal is in sight.

You're not stronger than the people who said you couldn't do it.\\
The difference is this:

You believed in yourself.\\

Whether you think you can or think you can't, You're right.
